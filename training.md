## ISTQB

Love them or hate them, they exist, and [provide certifications][3]. I've completed several over the years. Some have been more beneficial to me at the time that others. 

### Foundation: Certified Tester (2014)

So long ago I’ve forgotten the details. But basic introduction to core concepts, terms, techniques.

Only useful if built on with actual experience. Could get similar info across ourselves if needed. e.g. a crash course, supported my coaching / a more experienced partner.

Still a requirement for many industries?

### Agile Tester (2017)

Intro to agile and scrum concepts, CICD, how to plan testing for a sprint or many sprints. 

Different types of tests, and approaches. E.g. TDD, integration layer, test quadrants. Geared towards people in “agile transition”? 

Some good concepts in there, but people with previous experience won’t get the most out of it. Similar to the `certified tester`, could be delivered with hands on support.


### Test Automation Engineer (2018)

I did this after I already spent years automating and overall I found it too abstract and theoretical. Perhaps aimed at “higher ups” or organisation's new to automation. 

Good topics on automation objectives and setting up for success. Can find good sources on this elsewhere too. 

The “generic test automation architecture” was an interesting topic to explore and discuss, as a framework agnostic thing. Took some work to map things to what we were using, to solidify the understanding. 


### Test manager (2018)
At the time I was doing test management as part of my role, so was appropriate. 

Lots of different approaches to doing the testing and planning it all. Including automation, exploratory testing, non-functional. 

Interesting topics on process improvement, metrics, and the people you work with.
