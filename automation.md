# Automation
Place to collect useful info on Test automation, frameworks, approaches, etc.

## Videos
Workshops, presenations, anything I liked

## Capybara (Ruby)
Acceptance testing DSL that wraps around Selenium. Results in "acceptance test" like language in the tests.

- [Capybara Docs][1]
- [HM Land Registry Skeleton][2] I added lots of info on Capybara and Page Objects in the README and Wiki.
- [TAU: Introduction to Capybara][3]


## Cypress (JavaScript)
UI testing tooling used during development. Framework lives with the code, not separately.

## Gatling
